## :fire: Highlights <a name="high"></a>
<img width="1000" alt="seer" src="assets/seer_method.jpg">

- :trophy: **SOTA simulation performance** Seer achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulation benchmarks CALVIN ABC-D and LIBERO-LONG. 
- :muscle: **Impressive Real-World performance** Seer demonstrates strong effectiveness and generalization across diverse real-world downstream tasks.

## :door: Getting Started <a name="start"></a>
We provide step-by-step guidance for running Seer in simulations and real-world experiments.
Follow the specific instructions for a seamless setup.

### Simulation <a name="simulation"></a>
#### CALVIN ABC-D <a name="calvin abc-d"></a>
- [Installation](docs/CALVIN_ABC-D_INSTALL.md)
- [Running Code](docs/CALVIN_ABC-D_RUN.md)
### Real-World<a name="real-world"></a>
#### Real-World (Quick Training w & w/o pre-training)<a name="real-world-qs"></a>
For users aiming to train Seer from scratch or fine-tune it, we provide comprehensive instructions for environment setup, downstream task data preparation, training, and deployment.
- [Installation](docs/REAL-WORLD_INSTALL.md)
- [Post-processing](docs/REAL-WORLD_POSTPROCESS.md)
- [Fine-tuning & Scratch](docs/REAL-WORLD_FT_SC.md)
- [Inference](docs/REAL-WORLD_INFERENCE.md)

#### Real-World (Pre-training)<a name="real-world-fv"></a>
This section details the pre-training process of Seer in real-world experiments, including environment setup, dataset preparation, and training procedures. Downstream task processing and fine-tuning are covered in [Real-World (Quick Training w & w/o pre-training)](#real-world-qs).
